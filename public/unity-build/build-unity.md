# Real Unity 3D Build Instructions

To get the REAL 3D Unity visualization you want (like the architectural image you showed), you need to build an actual Unity WebGL project.

## Quick Unity Build Steps:

### 1. Install Unity (5 minutes)
- Download Unity Hub from https://unity.com/download
- Install Unity 2022.3 LTS or 2023.3 LTS
- Make sure to check "WebGL Build Support" during installation

### 2. Create Unity Project (2 minutes)
- Open Unity Hub → New Project → 3D Template
- Name: "KinqueScape"
- Location: Any folder on your computer

### 3. Set Up Scene (3 minutes)
- Create empty GameObject → name it "DungeonController"
- Add Component → New Script → "DungeonController"
- Copy the enhanced script from `unity-project/Assets/Scripts/DungeonController.cs`
- Position Main Camera at (0, 8, 10) looking at (0, 0, 0)

### 4. Import GLB Model (2 minutes)
- Copy `7_16_2025.glb` to Unity's Assets folder
- Unity will automatically import it
- Drag it into the scene to see your room in 3D

### 5. Build for WebGL (5 minutes)
- File → Build Settings
- Select "WebGL" → Switch Platform
- Player Settings → WebGL → Memory Size: 256MB
- Click "Build" → Select this folder: `public/unity-build/`
- Wait for build to complete

### 6. Test Real 3D
- Restart your dev server
- Go to `/room/dungeon`
- You'll see true Unity 3D with:
  - Real 3D room geometry from your GLB file
  - Proper lighting and shadows
  - 3D device positioning
  - Architectural camera perspective
  - Mouse controls for orbit/zoom

## What You'll Get:
✅ **Real Unity 3D Engine** - Not canvas simulation  
✅ **True GLB Loading** - Your 7_16_2025.glb file in 3D space  
✅ **Architectural View** - Like Unity editor perspective  
✅ **3D Device Objects** - Lights, props, cameras in 3D  
✅ **Real Materials** - Stone textures, lighting, shadows  
✅ **3D Navigation** - Mouse orbit, zoom, pan controls  

## Current Status:
❌ **Placeholder build files** - Need real Unity compilation  
✅ **React integration ready** - Communication bridge working  
✅ **Device data flowing** - 20 devices being sent to Unity  
✅ **GLB file available** - 7_16_2025.glb (145KB) ready to load  

The React component is already set up to communicate with real Unity. You just need to compile the actual Unity WebGL build to replace the placeholder files.
